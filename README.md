# PFRPG: Live Hitpoints from Constitution
This extension automates changes to hitpoints based on an ability score.

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.0.10 (2020-02-04).

# Features
* Tracks Ability Effects in the combat tracker to affect HP [3.5E]
* Tracks base Ability mod, Ability dmg, and scrollable Ability mod bonus to affect HP
* Separates HP into two boxes with a third total. Abil. HP for static/'rolled' HP and favored class bonuses, and Live HP for all others (which change on the fly).
* Populates the appropriate boxes on level-up
* New effect tag: "MHP: N" to raise max hitpoints (rather than temporary)
* Negative levels now lower hitpoints accordingly (in Unity but not Classic).
