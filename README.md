# HP From CON
Inspired by xBzGrumpyCat's Base HP Box extension, I decided to code an extension which would change the HP total whenever CON was changed.
CON Effects in the combat tracker, current CON mod, and the number of HP that have been rolled for are now added on the fly to create the total HP for each character.
