# PFRPG: Live Hitpoints from Constitution
Inspired by xBzGrumpyCat's Base HP Box extension, I decided to code an extension which would change the HP total whenever CON was changed.
# Features
Track CON Effects in the combat tracker to affect HP
Track base CON mod, CON dmg, and scrollable CON mod bonus to affect HP
Seperate HP into two boxes with a third total. HD HP for static/'rolled' HP and favored class bonuses, and Live HP for all others (which change on the fly).
Populates the appropriate boxes on level-up
New effect tag: "MHP: N" to raise max hitpoints (rather than temporary)
