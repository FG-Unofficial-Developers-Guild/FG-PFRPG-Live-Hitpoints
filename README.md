# PFRPG: Live Hitpoints from Constitution
Inspired by xBzGrumpyCat's Base HP Box extension, I decided to code an extension which automates the process by changing the HP total whenever CON was changed.

# Installation Instructions
1. Before installing this extension, write down each player's HP total.
2. Enable the extension in FG launcher.
3. Subtract the number in Live HP on the character sheet corresponding to each number you wrote down.
4. Write that number into the HD HP box on each respective character's sheet.

# Features
* Track CON Effects in the combat tracker to affect HP
* Track base CON mod, CON dmg, and scrollable CON mod bonus to affect HP
* Seperate HP into two boxes with a third total. HD HP for static/'rolled' HP and favored class bonuses, and Live HP for all others (which change on the fly).
* Populates the appropriate boxes on level-up
* New effect tag: "MHP: N" to raise max hitpoints (rather than temporary)
